The project was abandoned mid-development because the organization I was working with is being shuttered.

What is left to do for first MVP:
On start and recurring re-check of "room pressure"
- Used to calculate "pressure" in the bladder
- Shown on the dial as base pressure
Add record keeping:
- Add csv driver to the application
- record each launch pressure and time
- used for widgets
Add widgets to the launch page:
- Total launches/psi since started
- Total launches today -vs- average daily launches
- Histogram of launches for the past week/month/year
- Current date/time
- ??
